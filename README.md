# Fullscreen Video Mobile

Addon for Firefox for Android that add a menu item to make the current video fullscreen.

This is useful as currently the default video controls do not contain a fullscreen button and some video players (e.g. Youtube) disable
the context menu so you cannot make the video fullscreen from that menu.

Requires at least Firefox for Android 25.0
